# Data structures

## Set

Set has no order. 

## Array

Data structure optimized for data reading.

## Linked List

Data structure optimized for insertion and deletion.

## BST

Data structure optimized for searching.

- deletion - replace value with biggest left child or least right child

### AVL Tree

Specialized version of BST. Has self balancing method in the three.

## Heap

Heaps are kinda similar to BST (binary heap is an array, only guarantee is that parent is greater than children, it's complete), used a lot, frequently used in priority queues.

Left child of any index is `2n+1` where `n` is the index. Right child is `2n+2`.

### Max heap

Zero index is always biggest.

### Min heap

Zero index is always lowest.
