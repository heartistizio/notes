# Clean Code

## Comments

- should explain the why not what
- what should be obvious from the code

## Imperative vs Declarative Code

Imperative code focuses on the how, declarative code on the what and why.

Imperative code means that the future reader of the code has to do some mental execution of the code to find out what it does. That's hard for human brains. Declarative code by focusing on why would make code comments "obsolete".
