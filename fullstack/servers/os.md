# Operating System

## MS DOS vs unix

Ubuntu is the most popularion Linux distribution.

Linux runs on principle of two layers - kernel that talks to the machine layer and utilities that usually do one thing and interact with the kernel.

## POSIX Standard Streams

- stdout

## Redirection

```
| read from stdout

> write to stdout

>> append stdout to file

< read from stdin

2> read from stderr
```

useful options:
    -name
    -type
    -empty
    -executable
    -writable
```

### `grep`

```
