# Security

Bot networks are scanning all of the Internet and they are testing for vulnerabilities, test for weak password, open ports.

## SSH keys

Secure Socket Shell - very large key, as for now unbreakable. Made up of two parts:

- private key that decrypts, stays on the machine
- encrypts in a tunnel that noone can access
- public key that encrypts on the server

Safe against man in the middle.

## Auth log

Log of people trying to access the server.

## Security above security / Security by obscurity

Trying to obscure stuff does not usually give real benefits.
