Server is a computer that responds to requests.

## Data centers, Cloud

In the past companies and people used to have literal servers running, now it's all based in data centers - racks and racks of machines in high security, clean, cold enviroments.

They're spread around the world, making connections across the world faster.

Elastic computing is a way to scale servers as needed. Costs adjusts with the traffic. On demand capacity.

Most of the stuff needs just a fraction of the server, so they are isolated from other parts and can't talk to anything other on the server. It's called VPS.

## VPS

Virtual Private Server - piece of a server. Possible thanks to threading and process isolation.
