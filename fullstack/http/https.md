# HTTPS

Secure Socket Layers over HTTP. Their purpose is to protect traffic between client and a server by encrypting the data.

Certificate authorities validate that you are who you say you are.

Traffic is encrypted on client and decrypted on server. Client has a public certificate that it gets from a server. With the public certificate client encrypts the data.
