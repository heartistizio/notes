# Functions

- function declaration
- named function expression
- anonymous function expression
- arrow functions

## Which one to use?

- Strong case against using arrow functions and anonymous function expressions. - Name are usually more declarative than the code.
- If arrow function is assigned to the variable then why not use the declaration?
- Same with function expressions.
- Arrow functions still worthy when we care about keeping parents [this](./objects/this.md) value.
