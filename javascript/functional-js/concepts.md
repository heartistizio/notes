# Concepts

## Why write functional code?

### It's more declarative

- [Imperative vs Declarative](../../coding/clean-code.md)

### It's provable

Functional programming is math. That mean that the code you write is provable. That means that we can be certain what code will do.

## Functions

Most "functions" in JS code are just procedures. To be a pure function it needs to:

- have output that is related to the input
- call only other functions
- don't have side effects
