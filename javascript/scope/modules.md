# Modules

## Module pattern

- Module pattern is built upon [closure](./closure.md) and [scope](./scope.md).
- It requires **encapsulation** - a way to make data or functions private.
- It's not a **namespace** and it should have some sort of **state** that is
  accesible through functions thanks to closure.

## ES6 Modules

- Node.js and TC39 didn't really talk to each other so they were incompatible ;(
- now you can use ugly `.mjs` extension, but oh well they work now
- but hey transpilers!
